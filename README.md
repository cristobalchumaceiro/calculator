Project: Calculator Submission for The Odin Project

## Introduction
As part of the Foundations course on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about), I created this Calculator using JavaScript and HTML

## Skills
This is the last project of the foundations course, creating a calculator able to perform basic math operations like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Most of what I learned throughout the course was used in this project, with all the logic built in javascript, and some very light styling in CSS. It was a fun final task, with plenty of room for improvement left in.

## Conclusion
It was a fun final task, with plenty of room for improvement left in. I'd like to add a button for decimal points to do math with floating point numbers, and add a backspace button too. Adding keyboard support would also be a good way to practice event handling in JS.
