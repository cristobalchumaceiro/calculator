Project: Calculator Submission for The Odin Project

## Introduction
As part of the Foundations course on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about), I created this Calculator using JavaScript and HTML

## Skills
This is the last project of the foundations course, creating a calculator able to perform basic math operations like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Most of what I learned throughout the course was used in this project, with all the logic built in javascript, and some very light styling in CSS.

## Conclusion
It was a fun final task, adding in the extra functionality such as decimals, negatives, and keyboard support was a real test, and included some difficult tasks but I nonetheless persevered and have a working product.
